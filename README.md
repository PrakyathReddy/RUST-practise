This repo contains all the programs I used, to practise and master Rust. Also includes some notes on syntax, tips and candid learnings.

Keywords:

1. fn - to define a function
2. main() - special function that acts as an entrypoint to the program. Does not take any arguments and does not return any value. When you run a Rust program, execution begins in the main function.
3. macros - are a way of writing code that writes other code, which is known as metaprogramming.
4. println!() - to print to the console. Macro calls are always marked with an exclamation mark â€“ !.
5. rustc - terminal command to compile a rust program
6. statically typed - means that when you write code, you must specify what data type each variable is.
7. let - to declare a variable
8. println!("the icon is {}",icon_char); - here {} is the placeholder
