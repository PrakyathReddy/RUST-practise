/*
The syntax if let takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal 
sign. It works the same way as a match, where the expression is given to 
the match and the pattern is its first arm. In this case, the pattern is 
Some(max), and the max binds to the value inside the Some. We can then 
use max in the body of the if let block in the same way we used max in 
the corresponding match arm. The code in the if let block isn’t run if 
the value doesn’t match the pattern.
