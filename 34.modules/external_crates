3 ways to connect to an external crate in the [dependencies] section in cargo.toml file:

1. Using version
[dependencies]
time = "0.3"
You have connected the crate "time" version 0.3. In this case, cargo may use a younger version but less than 1.0.0.

2. Using git 
[dependencies]
time = { git = "https://github.com/time-rs/time.git" }

3. from local path
[dependencies]
time = { path = "../time" }
